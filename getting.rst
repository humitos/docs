.. note:: This is the open-beta version of the bot I will be adding various other features in the future as per the recommendation and suggesions of the community.

Getting Started
===============

Getting TheProfessional invited to server and to get it all set-up is quite easy and takes no time. But, at first we need to take care of few things.

**• PERMISSIONS**

First make sure that you have either 'Administrator' permission or you should be the server owner.

**• INVITE**

After you have the required permission you can invite the bot to your server with this `link! <https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?permissions=1916267615&client_id=755287373721370634&scope=bot>`_
